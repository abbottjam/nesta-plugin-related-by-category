# Nesta::Plugin::RelatedByCategory

A plugin for finding related articles to a Nesta article, based on a dead-simple idea:

*Given pages A and B, the more categories A and B have in common, the higher B's relevance to A.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'nesta-plugin-related-by-category'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install nesta-plugin-related-by-category

## Usage

You'd use this with something like the following piece of HAML:

  - if has_related_articles?(@page)
    %section.related-articles
      %h2 Related articles
      %ul
        - related_by_category(@page).each do |article|
          %li
            %a(href="#{article.abspath}")= article.heading

Then, at the bottom of your template file (page.haml is default), require it:

  = haml :related_articles, :layout => false

By default, the plugin will display 3 articles; this can be overridden by a number of your choice:

  related_by_category(@page, 5) # 2nd argument is the number of articles to display.
